                <p class="questions"> Pair programming is technique for programmers to work in pairs collaboratively. One person, the driver, assumes control of the keyboard. The other, the navigator, dictates code to the driver.</p>

                <p class="questions"> It fosters a more collaborative environment. Dividing up the roles into driver and navigator allows one person to focus on organizing the code and allows the other person to focus their mind on creating code rather than the physical act of typing code.  </p>

    <div> Joey's Reflection: It was an amazing experience! I was a little nervous but Nick was super easy to work with and very gracious and forgiving. I liked that he seemed game to try new things, even if neither of us were 100% sure we could do them. I can definitely see how it the pairing system benefits a novice-novice pairing even if I was more novice than Nick. I learned a lot and became more comfortable with CSS and HTML. I guess if there's one negative it's that we could have been a little more efficient with our time because we ended up taking awhile to finish the task, but I don't even think this is such a bad thing because the extra time was well worth it.</div>
