        <h1 class="darktext"> Classes vs Modules </h1>
        <p class="darktext">Ruby has two different terms that are often confused with one another. Classes and Modules</p>
        <p class="darktext">
        Classes are something I have more experience with since so far we've been praciticing more with objects. Classes are used in conjuction with object creation and they consist of methods constants and variables. They use can use both class methods and instance methods. 

        <p class="darktext">
          Modules by contrast are about providing methods that you can use across multiple classes. They are a collection of methods and constants. In some ways modules resemble a hash in that you can use them to logically group similar things. They are also useful for creating another "namespace" in order to prevent name clashes. One key difference is that the cannot create objects based on Ruby modules. </p>
        <p class="darktext">
          An analogy that might help is to think of a car as a class of vehicles and individual models as objects. You might think of another maker or brand of that type of vehicle as a module. While you can't make another subclass or create objects with modules, you CAN use them to add their functionality to another Ruby class. For example, you can create a module and use its methods multiple classes in Ruby.
