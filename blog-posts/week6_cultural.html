        <h1 class="darktext"> Stereotype Threat </h1>
        <p class="darktext">
          Stereotype threat at it's core is the risk of confirming a negative stereotype about yourself. This could be anyone of the many idenities you might have. An example might be if you are worried about being limited from achieving in a task due to being apart of a group.
        </p>
        <p class="darktext">
        In my personal experience, I definitely had struggles with stereotype threat in my life. There are multiple identities that I fall under that have some negative stereotypes associated with them. The most recent one occured recently when working in an elementary school and had to sub. Although I had worked many years with older students, I was doubtful that I could handle teaching and guiding a group of 4th graders. There were multiple factors at play here, the first being that there are very few (10% at the kindergarten level) male teachers in the lower grades. Secondly, there are few mexican and/or Filipino teachers in the schools I've worked at. While it's not something that was at the front of my mind, I did remember thinking upon being hired if I was simply a diversity hire. This made me doubt myself and my self worth as an educator. Luckily I was able to get some external praise from my supervisor in order to boost my self-worth and ego.

         <p class="darktext">
          In the future however I should be cognizant of not only taking external praise, but also being sure to have self-affirmation. I should encourage myself to think about think positively about my own self-worth in order to prevent myself from getting discouraged. This is also important for my peers. External self-worth can be even more effective and preventing and reducing stereotype threat.
        <p class="darktext">
        I should take the time to ask for more feedback from strangers. I will admit to feeling timid about my new peers when it comes to feedback and hesitate to ask for their assistance. I was able to push past that hesitation at times, but it i something I need to continue to go outside of my comfort zone to do. Afterall, if I can't do it in an online setting, than it will be harder to do in a real life setting.
