        <h1 class="darktext"> Conflict Management </h1>
        <p class="darktext">It's funny because in my past career I was always trying to manage conflicts with the students I worked with but haven't given much thought to the conflicts in my own life. The last one that I actually had that was super intense was a phone conversation about the state of teaching in this country. A friend of mine (lets call her Jessica) from college was finishing up her first year of leadteaching at a public high school. I was finishing my first year as a student teacher at a public K-8 school. </p>
        <p class="darktext">The conflict started with a conversation about different styles of teaching and different schools. Although I had some issues with the charter school I was teaching at, I saw a lot of benefit and thought highly of my colleagues. Jessica despised charter schools and found their approach to education to be widening the achievement gap and causing an anti-public-school-teacher rhetoric in the US. While I saw her point, I disagreed. This caused her to be frustrated and she began to insult my level of knowledge about educational issues. The statement that really struck a nerve was <span class="big"> How are you so ignorant? When is the last time you read a book?"</span></p>
        <p class="darktext">I'm not sure exactly why this got me so frustrated. Maybe because she was right that I wasn't on top of the issues, but more it was the condescending tone she took with me. This was the last straw however and I threw some explitives at her and hung up. Usually I don't get so heated but I was rather frustrated. She sent me some angry text messages which only fueled my rage further. I responded with "Done with you. Never talk to me again." At the time I meant it. While this ended the conflict, I wouldn't say it was a good way to end it. It was 7 year friendship down the drain.</p>
        <p class="darktext">If I could go back I should have recognized that this was an issue that we were both passionate about and that we needed time and space to have cooler heads about it. I should have communicated better what exactly was frustrating me and that if she was going to take the tone and attitude towards me, we couldn't have a discussion. About a year later I accidentally butt dialed her and we ended up chatting and she apologized for her behavior. The topic hasn't come up since. I realize that while she still might feel the same way, it's an idealogical difference between us that can be avoided. There are probably many issues with my close friends that, if brought up would incite an intense argument. I've realized that it's not something worth fighting about. It's similar to an internet argument. Usually no one's minds are changed and everyone just ends up frustrating. If there is a issue that is important, but will incite passion, it is best communicated through calm and careful writing than a verbal tirade.</p>
