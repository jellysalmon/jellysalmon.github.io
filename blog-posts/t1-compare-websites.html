		<a href="www.grantland.com" Grantland </a>  is one of my favorite sites because it is a mesh of two interests of mine. Professional sports and pop culture. As I enter the homepage I am immediately drawn to the top story which has a large picture as well as the smaller story featured to the left of the headline. As I take a step back, I do notice the two ads featured and how they take up a large portion of the screen. Adjectives I would use to describe the site include "plain, clean, categorized, sectional, updated." The website is really just for entertainment and the content includes television/music/film critique as well as sports analysis. Adjectives to describe the site's content and focus include "analytical, thoughtful, humourous, varied, focused." To find what I'm looking for, I can click author names, search, or click on one of the categories at the top. Quite easy to browse through everything. My mood depends on the author and the content. Some things like sports gambling and college football I find boring, but basketball and random pop culture is fascinating to me. I believe it does sell a book of some kind, I haven't bought it because I can read their content online.

	<div id="center"> The second website I looked at was <a href="www.fogu.com" . It's a very simplistic website that offers lots of information about the Harvest Moon video game franchise. I enjoy this site because I like Harvest Moon, but I'm mostly impressed by how effective it is despite being minimalist. The homepage itself is quite unimpressive, with a simple picture and a plain background. List visual adjectives. "plain, boring, text-heavy, readable, boxy." Five adjectives to describe content "specific, extensive, organized, easy, niche." It's easy to find what particular game you're looking for and from there there are lots of links on the sidebar, one sidebar for that specific game and another sidebar to navigate to another game. This makes it quite easy to find what you're looking for, the url structure is simple too. just fogu.com/hm##. I like browsing through the different content and comparing the different games from era to era, but that's probably just me.

<div id="right"> My third site is <a href="www.previously.tv" previously.tv </a>. I enjoy it because it has constant content updates and focuses only on television. As I visit the homepage I'm drawn to the two top stories with the largest pictures at the top of the page, as well as the navigation bar. Similarly to grantland, as i step back I notice how big the banner ad is. Four adjectives to decribe it are: "colorful, white space, image-heavy(top), text-heavy(bottom)." This is another entertainment website that simply provides recaps and opinions on television shows. It allows viewers to communicate about their latest show's dramatic happenings and provides humorous commentary. While this content isn't intellectual by any means, it is interesting to see how mega-enthusiasts approach their passion. Again, the search bar makes it easy to find other pages, there are also  tags so you can browse by show, author or content-type.
