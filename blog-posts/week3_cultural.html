        <p class="darktext">So far Phase 0 has been fine, but I realized that I benefit much more from a sequence of learning and doing simultaneously. Week 3 had a lot of reading page after page of text and I discovered that I had forgotten a lot of what I had read never got to practice them. In the future I need to make sure to be practicing more as I go. One strategy that I found is to have a console open to try things as I read. This was difficult on my new mac (i'm still getting used to it) but I discovered Cinch which allows me to easily resize windows to the edge of the screen windows 7 style. </p>

        <p class="darktext"> I think the biggest struggle has been the back and forth between subjects, getting a preliminary taste of a language then switching to a new one. I'm not sure how much retention there will be when we go back to javascript later in the year for instance. I know that after a few weeks of other topics, the Ruby stuff I had learned is a bit fuzzy and will need some refreshing. On a more topical analysis, code that has to deal with looping can be a bit of a brain strain between proper syntax and proper logic, there are a lot of ways that things can go wrong. I need to make sure that I'm staying in the zone of proximal development as well. If things are too advanced for me, instead of wasting time trying to decipher something over my head, I should work on learning the basics and then coming back to it. </p>

        <p class="darktext"> I will definitely try to keep the growth mindset in mind to keep myself motivated. Sometimes I find myself ilooking at the peak of the mountain of knowledge that needs to be conquered and getting discouraged when I should be looking at more attainable checkpoints and goals that are closer to the present.</p>
