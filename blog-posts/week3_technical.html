        <p class="darktext">Upon initial investigation, the first reasoning I found for javascript's popularity was that it was the language for Netscape Navigator which was one of the most popular web browsers at the time. Another claim was that because of the expressive power of the javascript language, even novice programmers were able to create useful things with it. Another writer I found tried explaining it in more technical terms, but without expert knowledge of other programming language, some of his arguments may have well have sounded like "Javascript is great because it has bazarkapop instead of berzerkepip!" Nonetheless, he did explain that functions in javascript are treated as objects, which makes working with them more conveinient. </p>
        <p class="darktext">When researching the downsides to javascript, the first thing I came upon was <a href="http://robertnyman.com/2008/10/16/beware-of-javascript-semicolon-insertion/"> semi-colon insertion. </a> which is actually a problem that I ran into when I was practicing basic javascript. It seems like they're not totally necessary and some javascript interpreters add them in, but unfortunately if you're code isn't syntactically correct, the interpreters will add semicolons to lines where they're not needed. </p>
