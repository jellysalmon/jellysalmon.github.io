        <h1 class="darktext"> Asking the Right Question </h1>
        <p class="darktext">One of the great things about the internet is the availablity of information. I've found that many websites can be a bit intimidating in their scope and language. The resource I've found to be most useful is <a href="stackoverflow.com" stackoverflow.com </a> because it often has specific questions with multiple answers, with the best answers usually at the top of the list. I've noticed however that quality of the answers oftentimes depends on the quality of the question asked. So, some tips for making a good question. </p>
        <p class ="darktext"> Before doing anything, make sure to check to see if the question, or something similar to it has been answered before. Next, explain the problem in clear terms where no context in necessary. In other words, make sure it makes sense to someone coming at it fresh. A good place for a summarized version of the problem would be the title of your message. If possible, make it into a question itself like "How do you insert DATETIME into SQL database tables?" Obviously providing as much information and context as needed is going to be helpful. Speficially questions that just ask say I tried to do xyz and it didn't work. Decribing what you want the outcome to be can really clear things up. Additionally, error messages that accompanied a failed attempted can also help. Lastly, if available, information like version, platform, operating system can be put into tags for more details.. </p>
        <p class ="darktext"> As I look over some of the questions I found on stackoverflow, i found one that has the title of "why isn't my alert coming up?" The text itself is a snippet of code with the message "Even if countReturnedRows == 0" the alert is still coming up when I search for person." While this question did provide tags, and a few keywords it could be improved by being more specific. Pointing to the code where he has the alert would be a start, but even better would be to have a specific "I tried this: _____", "got this______", "expected this ______" sort of scenario. The question also came off as a bit abrupt and could use some injections of politeness for the people who are about to help you with your problem. <p>
