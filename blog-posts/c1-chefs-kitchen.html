        <p class="darktext">As I was watching the fireside chat I found myself being drawn to Shereef's honing in on people who are kind and nice to get along with. Something I've noticed already is there a culture of kindness and the preliminary interactions I've had with people have been very much that. I really liked his reassurance that people are on a walk to Seattle and that some people are 100 steps in and some are 5 steps in. I definitely feel like a 5 stepper, but I hope to get there intact all the same. It seems like the experience is going to be really intense, but having other people in the same boat. It definitely seems like a long road ahead and my expectations of a big work load seem to be right on the money. Again, the background and friendlyness of the cohort is definitely not what I expected. I've come across some programmers and there seem to be a lot of ego thrown around. This makes me less apprehensive about the paired programming pracitce. I am a little nervous to be exposing my lack of knowledge and understanding about some topics, but I guess it's something that I'll just have to deal with.</p>
