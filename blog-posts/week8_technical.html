        <h1 class="darktext">Rails</h1>
        <p class="darktext">I did some research to find out what this Rails thing I've heard so much about really. The first thing to clear up is that Rails = Ruby on Rails. In case you've heard one or the other and assumed they were different. They're not. Now while Ruby is a programming language, Rails is a software library that extends the Ruby programming language. </p>
        <p class="darktext"> In essence Rails is a framework for building websites. It uses a set of conventions for creators to know and this allows for them to collaborate more easily. Rails combines Ruby with HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create web pages or web applications. Since modern web applications can have a lot of intricate functions and parts, Rails helps with their creation. </p>
        <p class="darktext"> There are a lot of reasons for why Rails is popular for  web application development. Firstly, in contrast to a language like Perl, which has many different ways to approach a problem, Rails has a "best way." This allows for more consistent solutions, few decisions to make and faster development. It also follows the principle of software development of keeping things DRY. This stands for "Don't Repeat Yourself" and is a mindset used to avoid duplication and to keep things simple and easy to follow. </p>
        <p class="darktext"> So how does Rails work in practice? Rails uses Ruby to assemble HTML, CSS and JavaScript files and also adding content from a database. While simple HTML might work for a basic website, Rails helps to organize your webpages. Additionally, Rails makes it so that features that have been created by other users can easily be added to your web application.</p>
