        <h1 class="darktext"> Pairing </h1>
        <p class="darktext">One of the things that was new to me when starting devbootcamp was the idea of paired programming. To be honest it seemed a bit intimidating. But having gone through it a few times with different people, I definitely see why it is used and why some people swear by it.</p>
        <p class="darktext">I knew that part of the reasoning behind it is to split up the task into someone handling the more creative aspect of it and the other focusing on the minute details of syntax. When you are the driver, you're focused on following instructions but also learning where your gaps in knowledge lie when you can't code instructions without explicit directions. Those moments are definitely teachable moments though because the act of writing out the code directed at you allows for so much more understanding and retention than if you had just read it or watched someone else coding it. As the navigator, it tests your expertise on a subject or language because being able to describe things so that someone can understand your intent requires a deeper understand of the topic yourself.</p>
        <p class="darktext">There are some frustrating moments though. If your partner isn't on the same page as you, it can lead to confusion. It can be frustrating for the navigator and driver if one isn't picking up what the other is putting down. Another source of frustration can stem from both partners not knowing how to proceed. As with any activity, there is definite room for improvement. The feedback that I have received has been positive, but I should make sure that I have a better basic grasp on the topic before delving in. There were a couple pairing sessions where I was a bit lost and spent more time on simple things instead of using that time to explore more advanced topics with my partner. Writing feedback can be tough on sessions that aren't super productive because it's not always clear what needs improving. If both of us couldn't figure out a solution, you can't just tellthe other person "solve harder!" but rather think of other ways to improve both of your pairing behaviors.</p>
