        <h3 class="darktext" Hashes</h3>
        <p class="darktext">Hashes in Ruby are one way to store various types of data to be manipulated or accessed later. Hashes differ from arrays because they store their data in pairs. Each entry in a hash has two parts, a value and a key. They look like this <span class="lighttext"> countrycapitol_hash = {"United States" => "Washington D.C.", "Mexico" => "Mexico City"}</span>. In this hash, the hash name is "countrycapitol_hash", the hash contents are everything inside of the curly braces. In this example there are two key:value pairs, each separated by a =>. On the left of the arrow are the keys (United States and Mexico) and to the right are the values (Washington DC and Mexico City). These key:value pairs are linked so you you ask for the value of "United States", you would get "Washington DC" and if you ask for the key of "Mexico City" you would get "Mexico" What's useful about hashes is that you can store more information in pairs than you can with a simple list like an array. Just like arrays, you can apply various methods or actions to a hash in order to manipulate the data stored within them. This is especially useful for making minor changes to large hashes without having to change each and every entry. Other useful things with hashes include various types of queries. You can use things like hash.key?() and hash.value?() to check if the hash contains a key or value. For example, countrycapitol_hash.key?(France) would return false because France is not included in the hash. In summary you can think of a hash as a paired list that is able to be sorted, manipulated or queried by other computer operations.</p>
