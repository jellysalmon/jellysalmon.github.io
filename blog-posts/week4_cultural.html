        <p class="darktext">Our assignment this week was to research a problem in the tech industry and writing about it. I decided to research a buzzword that's been spinning around for awhile that I haven't really been clear on: Net Neutrality. 
          
          First: What is Net Neutrality? Basically it is the idea that all data sent through the internet should be handled equally. For example, if I am watching a Netflix movie, I try to get that data from Netflix, but an Internet Service Provider is actually the one who delivers it to me. The ISP could choose that the Netflix movie is taking up too much of their resources and slow down the speed of the delivery or charge Netflix more money for having to use their resources on that particular website.. Net neutrality would prevent them from doing this.The FCC is currently ruling as to how the rules and regulations in regards to internet restrictions will pan out.

          It seems like there are two major sides involved in the dispute, internet companies like Google, Facebook and Netflix and the internet service providers like Comcast and Time Warner Cable. The internet companies argue that they should be able to charge the distributors of the data as well as the receivers. The internet companies argue that the ISPs shouldn't be able to restrict their data and also shouldn't be able to charge them extra for extra data usage. 

          Many internet users are for net neutrality and argue that putting a penatly charge for high demand content on the internet will dissuade innovators from creating new and popular content. Another facet of the issue is the proposed merger between Time Warner Cable and Comcast. Already two of the biggest ISPs, their merger would make any decisions to go against net neutrality that much more far reaching and additionally, lobbyists for these companies combined could have even more influence on government decisions.</p>
